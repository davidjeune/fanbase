    <h3>BAND BIO</h3>
    <p> Klass is a fairly new Haitian band that is beginning to make waves in the Haitian Music Industry. Not many people thought that the band would be a big hit since their inception in 2012, but they have taken the music industry by storm and arenâ€™t looking back any time soon.

        How High Can Klass Go?
        
        Maestro Richie and his band have taken Klass to new heights with their tremendous musical skills and desire to be perfect collectively. As a result, Klass has produced some of the most unique Konpa music in the Haitian Music Industry.
        
        Any time Klass has played in clubs or for other parties, the house has been completely packed. While this quick success could get to their heads, the group has stayed grounded and only looks to take their talents to the next level. In doing so, they hope to develop their fan base even more and create a brand that is unprecedented in the industry.
